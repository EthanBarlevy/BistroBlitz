Bistro Blitz is my senior capstone project.

I created it entirely in Unreal Engine 5.

This is an, online, two player, restaurant management game. This game was heavily insipired by Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes as each player has seprate roles. 
One player is in the kitchen making food, the other is taking orders and delivering the food. The catch is that the chef does not know what the orders are. The players must communicate to create the correct dishes and serve them correctly.

This game must be played on Steam.
